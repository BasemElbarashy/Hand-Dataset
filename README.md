# Hand-Dataset

In folders pos & neg, You can find positive and negative images extracted from hand dataset http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/hands/ and can be used for training hand classifier.

I modified their displaydata.m function to extract the poistive examples. I also extracted the negative examples from the same images.
