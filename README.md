# Hand-Dataset

In folders pos & neg, You can find positive and negative images extracted from hand dataset (training data) each image with size (60*60) and small hands (<1200 pixels) are excluded  http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/hands/. they can be used for training hand classifier.

I modified their displaydata.m function to extract the poistive examples. I also extracted the negative examples from the same images.
